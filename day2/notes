Part 1: present paper

input format
length L, width W, height H

surface area of box
2*L*W + 2*W*H + 2*H*L

2x3x4
2*2*3 + 2*2*3 + 2*3*3

slack
Area of smallest side
Area = L*W

Part 2: Ribbion length
ribbon width = same
length = variable
length = shortest distance arount present sides, or smallest primeter of any one face.

bow = cubic feet of volume of the present

length of ribbon = primeter = 2*Length + 2*Width
bow = cubic ft of volume = L*w*h
